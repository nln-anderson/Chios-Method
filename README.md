# Chios-Method
A coding project to implement a recursive program that calculates the determinant of a matrix using Chios Method. Outline of process comes from Heffernon, J. (2022). Linear Algebra, 4th Edition.
There is now a functional GUI. There are still potential issues, like when the first entry of the matrix is 0. My goal is to fix these issues to ensure the app runs smoothly.
